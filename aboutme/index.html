    <p>Hey everyone,
        I'm in my Senior year of working towards my bachelors in Computer Science. This course is one of my required courses for my degree. I currently live in Utah, 
        but am from Kalispell, MT. I grew up in Glacier Park National Park, and worked there in the summer during High School. It was amazing to see the wildlife in the park, and 
        enjoy just being able to see everything that Mother Nature has to offer. Glacier has a very special place in my heart. I currently work in Park City, UT for the city. 
        Park City is unique that it's a tourist town, but also you can drive anywhere for 4-5 min and be back in the mountains. I’m currently working on acquiring an internship 
        with work. 
        I am happily married to my best friend for 25 years, but we have been together for 29 years. We met shortly after graduating High School and I moved to Utah. We have three 
        kids, my oldest is 22, followed by a set of twins (a boy and a girl) both in 10th grade. Besides school and taking care of my family, I just enjoy camping, hunting and 
        hiking. We are part of a Mountain Man club where we re-enact 1840 mountain man trappers. We all dress up in period correct clothing and learn how it was to live during that 
        time. It’s so much fun and educational as well. We have a large Rendezvous over memorial weekend in Ogden, UT. It’s where everyone comes and we all live for 
        about a week like the mountain man did. We have traders, share stories and teach visitors what it was like back then. We usually have about 150 campers all in canvas tents, 
        then with the public we get a few hundred more visiting. My favorite part is shooting the black powder guns and the food. Nothing beats food cooked over an open flame.

    <p>Hey Everyone, Mickey Lee here and want to introduct myself. I'm a happily‑married‑for‑26‑years, tech‑studying, chicken‑tending, bee‑keeping ringmaster of a household that includes twin high‑school juniors 
        and two dogs who are absolutely certain they’re my biological children. When I’m not elbows‑deep in my Applied Technology coursework or whipping up 
        something dangerously delicious in the kitchen, you can find me buzzing around my beehives or time‑traveling at Mountain Men Rendezvous like it’s totally 
        normal weekend behavior. My life is a lively mash‑up of feathers, flour, family, and frontier flair — and honestly, the chaos just adds flavor.
</p>
